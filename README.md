# Smart Security System

## Overview
The Smart Security System is an Android application designed to detect motion in a room using the device's accelerometer sensor and send alerts to the user's phone when motion is detected. This README file provides information about the project, its purpose, how to use it, dependencies, and other relevant details.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a smart security system that enhances the security of homes, offices, vacation homes, and other spaces by detecting motion and sending alerts to the user's phone in real-time.

## How to Use
1. **Installation:**
   - Clone the repository to your local machine:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/your_username/smart-security-system.git
     ```

2. **Dependencies:**
   - Android Studio for development.
   - Retrofit library for making HTTP requests.
   - Android Sensor API for accelerometer sensor functionality.
   - Kotlin Coroutines: Used for asynchronous programming.
   - Simulation Platform: Integrated with a simulation platform for testing the system's functionality.

3. **Usage:**

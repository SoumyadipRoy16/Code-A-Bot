# Smart Security System

## Overview
The Smart Security System is an Android application designed to detect motion in a room using the device's accelerometer sensor and send alerts to the user's phone when motion is detected. This README file provides information about the project, its purpose, how to use it, dependencies, and other relevant details.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a smart security system that enhances the security of homes, offices, vacation homes, and other spaces by detecting motion and sending alerts to the user's phone in real-time.

## Features
- Motion detection using the accelerometer sensor
- Real-time alerts sent to the user's phone
- Integration with a simulation platform for testing purposes
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the project from the GitHub repository.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the application on an Android device or emulator.
4. Press the "Start Monitoring" button to begin monitoring motion.
5. Receive alerts on your phone when motion is detected.

## Dependencies
- Android Studio: The project is developed using Android Studio IDE.
- Android Sensor API: Utilized for accessing the accelerometer sensor for motion detection.
- Retrofit: Used for making HTTP requests to send alerts to the server.
- Kotlin Coroutines: Used for asynchronous programming.
- Simulation Platform: Integrated with a simulation platform for testing the system's functionality.
